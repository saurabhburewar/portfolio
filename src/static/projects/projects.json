Developed CNN Re-colorization approach for RGB-to-NIR image conversion, evaluated with MSE & human assessment.Applied postprocessing (joint bilateral filter, contrast/saturation adjustment) to reduce noise and enhance visibility. Built a CNN-based approach to predict temperature from images, achieving 52% accuracy.",
